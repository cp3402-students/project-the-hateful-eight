Development and deployment workflow

Project Management

Trello 
- Before you start any task, check the Trello board (https://trello.com/b/bBNlYnN4/the-hateful-eights-project-planning) and check if your task is not currently being done by someone else
- Remember to finish what you are doing under "Currently doing" before you start a new task. If you are done, move the task to "Done".
- If your task is not currently being done, see if you can start on any of the cards listed in "Next actions", or "Project Management Details" cards.
- If you start working on something, make a new card under it's respective list, and put your name on it.
