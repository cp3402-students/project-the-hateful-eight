  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>Brief description of local environments used by team members</p>
  <p>
    The chosen local environment setup was local by flywheel also known as 'Local'.
    Another option we had was vagrant however vagrant isn't compatible with the M1 and one of our members uses a Mac
    with an M1 chip. Another reason why Local chosen was because of its intuitive interface and outstanding user
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Local by flywheel is a powerful local development environment that is used by web developers and designers. Local
    allows developers to set up a virtual server environment that replicates the necessary components for running a
    WordPress site - this includes servers, databases and PHP.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the key features of Local is its ease of use. It offers a streamlined workflow, allowing developers to create
    locally hosted WordPress sites with ease - handling all the setup processes such as choosing a database version and
    PHP version (custom versions can be used). Local also offers handling migrated sites from the main WordPress site
    to the local site through a zip file. This process handles everything such as media files, themes, plugins, extra
    files and core WordPress files.
